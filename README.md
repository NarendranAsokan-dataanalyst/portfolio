Project Report: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Coffee Chain Dataset
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing sales data from a coffee chain. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve business operations and decision-making. This analysis will focus on understanding the data through visualizations and summary statistics.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains various attributes related to coffee chain sales, which likely includes details such as:

Sales information
Product details
Customer-related data (if applicable)
Store locations and other operational details
This dataset is ideal for performing an analysis of sales performance, product preferences, customer behavior, and operational efficiency across various store locations.

Methodology
Loading the Dataset: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation and analysis.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing or null values in the dataset, which were either removed or imputed based on the nature of the data.
Checked for duplicates or inconsistencies that may skew the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Summary Statistics: Calculated basic summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Data Visualization:
Plotted histograms to understand the distribution of variables like sales, revenue, and other key metrics.
Created bar plots to visualize categorical variables such as product types, stores, or regions.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap was used to find correlations between different numerical attributes to identify any strong relationships, such as between sales and product prices.
Insights:

The top-selling products, and which store locations generate the most revenue.
Time trends such as peak sales hours or days, and seasonal trends across stores.
Identified any regions or products that underperform and may need targeted strategies to boost sales.
Key Findings
Sales Trends:

Specific regions or stores consistently outperform others, likely due to local demand or better management.
Certain products dominate in terms of sales, while others may not contribute much to revenue.
Customer Preferences:

Customers show clear preferences for specific types of coffee or food items.
Discounts and promotions have a positive impact on sales but may vary depending on location.
Recommendations:

Invest more resources in top-performing stores and introduce product variety based on regional preferences.
Consider adjusting product offerings or prices in underperforming locations to match customer preferences.
Conclusion
The EDA provided valuable insights into the sales performance of the coffee chain. These findings can help the company make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase profitability.
